Ward names exercise:
save data into variable using:
tor_ward_resp = HTTParty.get('https://represent.opennorth.ca/boundaries/toronto-wards/')

parsing seemed to do nothing, but I was able to work with tor_ward_resp as such:
note, I now see that I needed to call the parse method passing tor_ward_resp.body as an argument
this converts the resp to a string, which the parse method needs to work properly

tor_ward_resp["objects"] # gives me an array where each element is a hash containing information about a ward

I iterated through and stored the names of each ward using:

array_of_ward_names = tor_ward_resp["objects"].map { |ward| ward["name"] }
